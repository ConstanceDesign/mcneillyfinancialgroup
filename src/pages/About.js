      <p className="description">Patrick McNeilly's relationship with each of his clients begins with the development of a comprehensive financial plan targeting their values and their long-term financial goals. As part of this plan he covers the investment, insurance, tax and estate planning aspects of each client's situation.</p>
      <p className="description">Patrick strives to act as his clients' chief financial advisor. As part of this role, he coordinates the activities of their existing professional advisors such as tax accountants and lawyers. If required, he will also tap into his own network of professional advisors.</p>
      <p className="description">His investment philosophy is essentially conservative in nature. Operating within each client's carefully determined risk profile, an investment portfolio is structured to achieve the client's needs without undue risk.</p>
      <p className="description">Income tax planning and tax minimization strategies are key components of Patrick's financial plan for all clients. As part of his overall plan, strategies such as income splitting, family trusts and the prudent use of leverage are evaluated.</p>
      <p className="description">Each client's plan and portfolio are monitored on an ongoing basis to take advantage of opportunities created by changing circumstances. In addition, each plan and each portfolio are reviewed, at least annually, and appropriate changes made.</p>
      <p className="description">Patrick makes himself as accessible to clients as possible. To that end, all telephone calls are returned on the same business day, either personally or by one of his assistants. E-mail messages are returned or acknowledged within 24 hours.</p>
